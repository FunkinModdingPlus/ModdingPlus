How to use:
  Custom Songs:
    Make a new folder in assets/data
    Name it what you want the song name to be but lowercase and replace spaces
    with "-"
    (like Life Will Change > life-will-change)
    Add json files to folder
    Rename each file to the folder name + the difficulty ending, if applicable
    + .json
    Make a temp folder in assets/music
    Add the music to the folder
    Rename them to the name of the song with hyphens ("-") with the suffix
    (like Life Will Change > Life-Will-Change)
    Drag them out to assets/music
    Open assets/data/freeplaySongJson.jsonc
    Add the song name to it, with the same name as the music files
    (like Life Will Change > Life-Will-Change)
    Launch FNF
    For each difficulty:
    Open the song
    Hit the '7' key
    Go to the song tab
    Click on the text box
    Replace what is in there with the name of the music files
    (like Life Will Change > Life-Will-Change)
    Hit 'Save'
    Save the file and remember to add the difficulty suffix
    After finishing this add the saved file to the assets/data/(name of the 
    song) folder and overwrite
  Custom Characters:
    Go to assets/images/custom_chars
    Drag in the mod png and xml (if no xml grab the base game one)
    Rename them to the name of the character (should be lowercase)
    If there are custom icons:
      Add the iconGrid.png
      Rename to (character name)_icons.png
    Open assets/images/custom_chars/custom_chars.jsonc
    Add a new property:
      "(character name)": {
        "like": "(character this is based on)",
        "icons": [(alive icon number),(dead icon number)]
      }
    Remember your commas!
    Characters also now support portraits.
    If your character has a portrait drag it in and rename it to your character
    name + '-portrait'
    They also support custom death sprites.
    If your character is based on pixel bf:
    drag in the death png + xml
    rename to '(character name)-dead'
    If it is based on bf: Great! Everything is already done for custom death!
    To apply these characters:
    Open a song in normal mode (important!)
    Hit the '7' key
    go to the char tab
    Click on one of the textboxes that states the name of the default character
    and replace it with the name of your custom character
    Go to the Song tab
    Hit save and save the json. (easy and hard modes use the characters from
    normal mode, so no need to repeat the process for them)
    Custom GF:
      Follow above instructions but instead click on the 2nd text box from the
      left.
      Enter the name of the custom gf
      Go to the Song tab
      Hit save and save the json. Remember difficulty prefixes!

  Custom Weeks:
    If your mod has a custom week icon:
      Add the xml and png to the assets/images/campaign-ui-week folder
      (if no xml then grab one from one of the other weeks)
      rename them to what the week position is (week6, week7, week8)
    Else:
      Copy one of the weeks png + xml into the assets/images/campaign-ui-week
      and rename them to the week position (week7,week8,week9)
    Open assets/data/storySonglist.json
    Add a new week:
      ["(animation name of the week, look at default weeks)", "(trackname)", "(trackname)", ...]
