'Delete') from the text context menu. This
event is dispatched to the object that
currently has focus. If the object that
currently has focus is a TextField, the
default behavior of this event is to cause
any currently selected text in the text field
to be deleted.</p></td></tr><tr class="indent"><th style="width:25%;"><code>click</code></th><td><p>Dispatched when a user presses and releases
the main button of the user's pointing device
over the same InteractiveObject. For a click
event to occur, it must always follow this
series of events in the order of occurrence:
mouseDown event, then mouseUp. The target
object must be identical for both of these
events; otherwise the <code>click</code>
event does not occur. Any number of other
mouse events can occur at any time between
the <code>mouseDown</code> or
<code>mouseUp</code> events; the

context menu associated with this interactive
object in an AIR application.</p></td></tr><tr class="indent"><th style="width:25%;"><code>copy</code></th><td><p>Dispatched when the user activates the
platform-specific accelerator key combination
for a copy operation or selects 'Copy' from
the text context menu. This event is
dispatched to the object that currently has
focus. If the object that currently has focus
is a TextField, the default behavior of this
event is to cause any currently selected text
in the text field to be copied to the
clipboard.</p></td></tr><tr class="indent"><th style="width:25%;"><code>cut</code></th><td><p>Dispatched when the user activates the
platform-specific accelerator key combination
for a cut operation or selects 'Cut' from the
text context menu. This event is dispatched
to the object that currently has focus. If
the object that currently has focus is a
TextField, the default behavior of this event
is to cause any currently selected text in
the text field to be cut to the clipboard.</p></td></tr><tr class="indent"><th style="width:25%;"><code>doubleClick</code></th><td><p>Dispatched when a user presses and releases
the main button of a pointing device twice in
rapid succession over the same
InteractiveObject when that object's
<code>doubleClickEnabled</code> flag is set
to <code><a href="../../Bool.html">true</a></code>. For a
<code>doubleClick</code> event to occur, it
must immediately follow the following series
of events: <code>mouseDown</code>,
<code>mouseUp</code>, <code>click</code>,
<code>mouseDown</code>, <code>mouseUp</code>.
All of these events must share the same
target as the <code>doubleClick</code> event.
The second click, represented by the second
<code>mouseDown</code> and
<code>mouseUp</code> events, must occur
within a specific period of time after the
<code>click</code> event. The allowable
length of this period varies by operating
system and can often be configured by the
user. If the target is a selectable text
field, the word under the pointer is selected
as the default behavior. If the target
InteractiveObject does not have its
<code>doubleClickEnabled</code> flag set to
<code><a href="../../Bool.html">true</a></code> it receives two
<code>click</code> events.</p>
<p>The <code>doubleClickEnabled</code>
property defaults to <code><a href="../../Bool.html">false</a></code>.</p>
<p>The double-click text selection behavior
of a TextField object is not related to the

control TextField selections.</p></td></tr><tr class="indent"><th style="width:25%;"><code>focusIn</code></th><td><p>Dispatched <em>after</em> a display object
gains focus. This situation happens when a
user highlights the object with a pointing
device or keyboard navigation. The recipient
of such focus is called the target object of
this event, while the corresponding
InteractiveObject instance that lost focus
because of this change is called the related
object. A reference to the related object is
stored in the receiving object's
<code>relatedObject</code> property. The
<code>shiftKey</code> property is not used.
This event follows the dispatch of the
previous object's <code>focusOut</code>
event.</p></td></tr><tr class="indent"><th style="width:25%;"><code>focusOut</code></th><td><p>Dispatched <em>after</em> a display object
loses focus. This happens when a user
highlights a different object with a pointing
device or keyboard navigation. The object
that loses focus is called the target object
of this event, while the corresponding
InteractiveObject instance that receives
focus is called the related object. A
reference to the related object is stored in
the target object's

<code>shiftKey</code> property is not used.
This event precedes the dispatch of the
<code>focusIn</code> event by the related
object.</p></td></tr><tr class="indent"><th style="width:25%;"><code>gesturePan</code></th><td><p>Dispatched when the user moves a point of
contact over the InteractiveObject instance
on a touch-enabled device(such as moving a
finger from left to right over a display
object on a mobile phone or tablet with a
touch screen). Some devices might also
interpret this contact as a
<code>mouseOver</code> event and as a
<code>touchOver</code> event.</p>
<p>Specifically, if a user moves a finger
over an InteractiveObject, the
InteractiveObject instance can dispatch a

device and a mouse enabled device. However,
if you choose to handle the
<code>gesturePan</code> event, you can design
your event handler to respond to the specific
needs of a touch-enabled environment and
provide users with a richer touch-enabled
experience. You can also handle both events,

for a touch event than a mouse event.</p>
<p><strong>Note:</strong> See the Multitouch class for
environment compatibility information.</p></td></tr><tr class="indent"><th style="width:25%;"><code>gesturePressAndTap</code></th><td><p>Dispatched when the user creates a point of
contact with an InteractiveObject instance,
then taps on a touch-enabled device(such as
placing several fingers over a display object
to open a menu and then taps one finger to
select a menu item on a mobile phone or
tablet with a touch screen). Some devices
might also interpret this contact as a
combination of several mouse events, as well.</p>
<p>Specifically, if a user moves a finger
over an InteractiveObject, and then provides
a secondary tap, the InteractiveObject
instance can dispatch a
<code>mouseOver</code> event and a
<code>click</code> event(among others) as
well as the <code>gesturePressAndTap</code>
event, or all if the current environment
supports it. Choose how you want to handle
the user interaction. Use the

<p>When handling the properties of the event
object, note that the <code>localX</code> and

primary point of contact(the "push"). The
<code>offsetX</code> and <code>offsetY</code>
properties are the distance to the secondary
point of contact(the "tap").</p></td></tr><tr class="indent"><th style="width:25%;"><code>gestureRotate</code></th><td><p>Dispatched when the user performs a rotation
gesture at a point of contact with an
InteractiveObject instance(such as touching
two fingers and rotating them over a display
object on a mobile phone or tablet with a
touch screen). Two-finger rotation is a
common rotation gesture, but each device and
operating system can have its own
requirements to indicate rotation. Some
devices might also interpret this contact as
a combination of several mouse events, as
well.</p>
<p>Specifically, if a user moves a finger
over an InteractiveObject, the
InteractiveObject instance can dispatch a

gesture at a point of contact with an
InteractiveObject instance(such as touching
three fingers to a screen and then moving
them in parallel over a display object on a
mobile phone or tablet with a touch screen).
Moving several fingers in parallel is a
common swipe gesture, but each device and
operating system can have its own
requirements for a swipe. Some devices might
also interpret this contact as a combination
of several mouse events, as well.</p>
<p>Specifically, if a user moves a finger
over an InteractiveObject, and then moves the
fingers together, the InteractiveObject
instance can dispatch a <code>rollOver</code>
event and a <code>rollOut</code> event(among
others), in addition to the

<p>This event is dispatched to the object
that currently has focus. The related object
for this event is the InteractiveObject
instance that receives focus if you do not
prevent the default behavior. You can prevent
the change in focus by calling the

pointing device has moved to. If the target
is a SimpleButton instance, the button
displays the <code>upState</code> display
object as the default behavior.</p>
<p>The <code>mouseOut</code> event is
dispatched each time the mouse leaves the

<code><a href="../../openfl/display/BlendMode.html#NORMAL">BlendMode.NORMAL</a></code>.</p>
<p>The <code>blendMode</code> property affects each pixel of the display
object. Each pixel is composed of three constituent colors(red, green,
and blue), and each constituent color has a value between 0x00 and 0xFF.
Flash Player or Adobe AIR compares each constituent color of one pixel in
the movie clip with the corresponding color of the pixel in the
background. For example, if <code>blendMode</code> is set to
<code><a href="../../openfl/display/BlendMode.html#LIGHTEN">BlendMode.LIGHTEN</a></code>, Flash Player or Adobe AIR compares the red
value of the display object with the red value of the background, and uses
the lighter of the two as the value for the red component of the displayed
color.</p>
<p>The following table describes the <code>blendMode</code> settings. The
BlendMode class defines string values you can use. The illustrations in
the table show <code>blendMode</code> values applied to a circular display
object(2) superimposed on another display object(1).</p>

to the bitmap instead of the main display. If
<code>cacheAsBitmapMatrix</code> is null or unsupported, the bitmap is
then copied to the main display as unstretched, unrotated pixels snapped
to the nearest pixel boundaries. Pixels are mapped 1 to 1 with the parent
object. If the bounds of the bitmap change, the bitmap is recreated
instead of being stretched.</p>
<p>If <code>cacheAsBitmapMatrix</code> is non-null and supported, the
object is drawn to the off-screen bitmap using that matrix and the
stretched and/or rotated results of that rendering are used to draw the
object to the main display.</p>
<p>No internal bitmap is created unless the <code>cacheAsBitmap</code>
property is set to <code><a href="../../Bool.html">true</a></code>.</p>
<p>After you set the <code>cacheAsBitmap</code> property to
<code><a href="../../Bool.html">true</a></code>, the rendering does not change, however the display
object performs pixel snapping automatically. The animation speed can be
significantly faster depending on the complexity of the vector content.</p>
<p>The <code>cacheAsBitmap</code> property is automatically set to
<code><a href="../../Bool.html">true</a></code> whenever you apply a filter to a display object(when
its <code>filter</code> array is not empty), and if a display object has a
filter applied to it, <code>cacheAsBitmap</code> is reported as
<code><a href="../../Bool.html">true</a></code> for that display object, even if you set the property to
<code><a href="../../Bool.html">false</a></code>. If you clear all filters for a display object, the
<code>cacheAsBitmap</code> setting changes to what it was last set to.</p>
<p>A display object does not use a bitmap even if the
<code>cacheAsBitmap</code> property is set to <code><a href="../../Bool.html">true</a></code> and
instead renders from vector data in the following cases:</p><ul><li>The bitmap is too large. In AIR 1.5 and Flash Player 10, the maximum
size for a bitmap image is 8,191 pixels in width or height, and the total
number of pixels cannot exceed 16,777,215 pixels.(So, if a bitmap image
is 8,191 pixels wide, it can only be 2,048 pixels high.) In Flash Player 9
and earlier, the limitation is is 2880 pixels in height and 2,880 pixels
in width.</li><li>The bitmap fails to allocate(out of memory error).</li></ul>
<p>The <code>cacheAsBitmap</code> property is best used with movie clips
that have mostly static content and that do not scale and rotate
frequently. With such movie clips, <code>cacheAsBitmap</code> can lead to
performance increases when the movie clip is translated(when its <em>x</em>
and <em>y</em> position is changed).</p></div></div><div class="field "><a name="cacheAsBitmapMatrix"></a><h3 class="anchor"><code><a href="#cacheAsBitmapMatrix"><span class="identifier">cacheAsBitmapMatrix</span></a>:<a class="type" title="openfl.geom.Matrix - The Matrix class represents a transformation matrix that determines how to map points from one coordinate space to another." href="../../openfl/geom/Matrix.html">Matrix</a></code></h3><div class="doc"><p>If non-null, this Matrix object defines how a display object is rendered when <code>cacheAsBitmap</code> is set to
<code><a href="../../Bool.html">true</a></code>. The application uses this matrix as a transformation matrix that is applied when rendering the
bitmap version of the display object.</p>
<p><em>AIR profile support:</em> This feature is supported on mobile devices, but it is not supported on desktop
operating systems. It also has limited support on AIR for TV devices. Specifically, on AIR for TV devices,
supported transformations include scaling and translation, but not rotation and skewing. See AIR Profile
Support for more information regarding API support across multiple profiles.</p>
<p>With <code>cacheAsBitmapMatrix</code> set, the application retains a cached bitmap image across various 2D
transformations, including translation, rotation, and scaling. If the application uses hardware acceleration,
the object will be stored in video memory as a texture. This allows the GPU to apply the supported
transformations to the object. The GPU can perform these transformations faster than the CPU.</p>
<p>To use the hardware acceleration, set Rendering to GPU in the General tab of the iPhone Settings dialog box
in Flash Professional CS5. Or set the <code>renderMode</code> property to gpu in the application descriptor file. Note
that AIR for TV devices automatically use hardware acceleration if it is available.</p>
<p>For example, the following code sends an untransformed bitmap representation of the display object to the GPU:</p>
<pre><code class="prettyprint haxe">var matrix:Matrix = new Matrix(); // creates an identity matrix
mySprite.cacheAsBitmapMatrix = matrix;
mySprite.cacheAsBitmap = true;</code></pre>
<p>Usually, the identity matrix (<code>new <a href="../../openfl/geom/Matrix.html#Matrix">Matrix</a>()</code>) suffices. However, you can use another matrix, such as a
scaled-down matrix, to upload a different bitmap to the GPU. For example, the following example applies a
<code>cacheAsBitmapMatrix</code> matrix that is scaled by 0.5 on the x and y axes. The bitmap object that the GPU uses
is smaller, however the GPU adjusts its size to match the <code>transform.matrix</code> property of the display object:</p>
<pre><code class="prettyprint haxe">var matrix:Matrix = new Matrix(); // creates an identity matrix
matrix.scale(0.5, 0.5); // scales the matrix
mySprite.cacheAsBitmapMatrix = matrix;
mySprite.cacheAsBitmap = true;</code></pre>
<p>Generally, you should choose to use a matrix that transforms the display object to the size that it will
appear in the application. For example, if your application displays the bitmap version of the sprite scaled
down by a half, use a matrix that scales down by a half. If you application will display the sprite larger
than its current dimensions, use a matrix that scales up by that factor.</p>
<p><strong>Note:</strong> The <code>cacheAsBitmapMatrix</code> property is suitable for 2D transformations. If you need to apply
transformations in 3D, you may do so by setting a 3D property of the object and manipulating its
<code>transform.matrix3D</code> property. If the application is packaged using GPU mode, this allows the 3D transforms
to be applied to the object by the GPU. The <code>cacheAsBitmapMatrix</code> is ignored for 3D objects.</p></div></div><div class="field "><a name="filters"></a><h3 class="anchor"><code><a href="#filters"><span class="identifier">filters</span></a>:<a class="type" title="Array" href="../../Array.html">Array</a>&lt;<a class="type" title="openfl.filters.BitmapFilter - The BitmapFilter class is the base class for all image filter effects." href="../../openfl/filters/BitmapFilter.html">BitmapFilter</a>&gt;</code></h3><div class="doc"><p>An indexed array that contains each filter object currently associated
with the display object. The openfl.filters package contains several
classes that define specific filters you can use.</p>
<p>Filters can be applied in Flash Professional at design time, or at run
time by using ActionScript code. To apply a filter by using ActionScript,
you must make a temporary copy of the entire <code>filters</code> array,
modify the temporary array, then assign the value of the temporary array
back to the <code>filters</code> array. You cannot directly add a new
filter object to the <code>filters</code> array.</p>
<p>To add a filter by using ActionScript, perform the following steps
(assume that the target display object is named
<code>myDisplayObject</code>):</p><ol><li>Create a new filter object by using the constructor method of your
chosen filter class.</li><li>Assign the value of the <code>myDisplayObject.filters</code> array
to a temporary array, such as one named <code>myFilters</code>.</li><li>Add the new filter object to the <code>myFilters</code> temporary
array.</li><li>Assign the value of the temporary array to the
<code>myDisplayObject.filters</code> array.</li></ol>
<p>If the <code>filters</code> array is undefined, you do not need to use
a temporary array. Instead, you can directly assign an array literal that
contains one or more filter objects that you create. The first example in
the Examples section adds a drop shadow filter by using code that handles
both defined and undefined <code>filters</code> arrays.</p>
<p>To modify an existing filter object, you must use the technique of
modifying a copy of the <code>filters</code> array:</p><ol><li>Assign the value of the <code>filters</code> array to a temporary
array, such as one named <code>myFilters</code>.</li><li>Modify the property by using the temporary array,
<code>myFilters</code>. For example, to set the quality property of the
first filter in the array, you could use the following code:
<code>myFilters[0].quality = 1;</code></li><li>Assign the value of the temporary array to the <code>filters</code>
array.</li></ol>
<p>At load time, if a display object has an associated filter, it is
marked to cache itself as a transparent bitmap. From this point forward,
as long as the display object has a valid filter list, the player caches
the display object as a bitmap. This source bitmap is used as a source
image for the filter effects. Each display object usually has two bitmaps:
one with the original unfiltered source display object and another for the
final image after filtering. The final image is used when rendering. As
long as the display object does not change, the final image does not need
updating.</p>
<p>The openfl.filters package includes classes for filters. For example, to
create a DropShadow filter, you would write:</p><p class="javadoc">Throws:</p><table class="table table-bordered params"><tr class="indent"><th style="width:25%;"><code>ArgumentError</code></th><td><p>When <code>filters</code> includes a ShaderFilter

is the top-most display object in the portion of the display list's tree
structure represented by that SWF file. For a Bitmap object representing a

itself. For the instance of the main class of the first SWF file loaded,
the <code>root</code> property is the display object itself. The
<code>root</code> property of the Stage object is the Stage object itself.
The <code>root</code> property is set to <code>null</code> for any display
object that has not been added to the display list, unless it has been
added to a display object container that is off the display list but that
is a child of the top-most display object in a loaded SWF file.</p>
<p>For example, if you create a new Sprite object by calling the
<code><a href="../../openfl/display/Sprite.html#Sprite">Sprite</a>()</code> constructor method, its <code>root</code> property
is <code>null</code> until you add it to the display list(or to a display
object container that is off the display list but that is a child of the
top-most display object in a SWF file).</p>
<p>For a loaded SWF file, even though the Loader object used to load the
file may not be on the display list, the top-most display object in the
SWF file has its <code>root</code> property set to itself. The Loader
object does not have its <code>root</code> property set until it is added

If set to <code>null</code>,
the entire display object is scaled normally when any scale transformation
is applied.</p>
<p>When you define the <code>scale9Grid</code> property, the display
object is divided into a grid with nine regions based on the
<code>scale9Grid</code> rectangle, which defines the center region of the
grid. The eight other regions of the grid are the following areas:</p><ul><li>The upper-left corner outside of the rectangle</li><li>The area above the rectangle</li><li>The upper-right corner outside of the rectangle</li><li>The area to the left of the rectangle</li><li>The area to the right of the rectangle</li><li>The lower-left corner outside of the rectangle</li><li>The area below the rectangle</li><li>The lower-right corner outside of the rectangle</li></ul>
<p>You can think of the eight regions outside of the center (defined by
the rectangle) as being like a picture frame that has special rules
applied to it when scaled.</p>
<p><strong>Note:</strong> Content that is not rendered through the <code>graphics</code> interface
of a display object will not be affected by the <code>scale9Grid</code> property.</p>
<p>When the <code>scale9Grid</code> property is set and a display object
is scaled, all text and gradients are scaled normally; however, for other
types of objects the following rules apply:</p><ul><li>Content in the center region is scaled normally.</li><li>Content in the corners is not scaled.</li><li>Content in the top and bottom regions is scaled horizontally only.</li><li>Content in the left and right regions is scaled vertically only.</li><li>All fills (including bitmaps, video, and gradients) are stretched to
fit their shapes.</li></ul>
<p>If a display object is rotated, all subsequent scaling is normal(and
the <code>scale9Grid</code> property is ignored).</p>
<p>For example, consider the following display object and a rectangle that
is applied as the display object's <code>scale9Grid</code>:</p><table><thead><th></th><th></th></thead><tbody><tr><td><img src="/images/scale9Grid-a.jpg" alt="display object image" /><br>The display object.</td><td><img src="/images/scale9Grid-b.jpg" alt="display object scale 9 region" /><br>The red rectangle shows the scale9Grid.</td></tr></tbody></table>
<p>When the display object is scaled or stretched, the objects within the rectangle scale normally, but the
objects outside of the rectangle scale according to the <code>scale9Grid</code> rules:</p><table><thead><th></th><th></th></thead><tbody><tr><td>Scaled to 75%:</td><td><img src="/images/scale9Grid-c.jpg" alt="display object at 75%" /></td></tr><tr><td>Scaled to 50%:</td><td><img src="/images/scale9Grid-d.jpg" alt="display object at 50%" /></td></tr><tr><td>Scaled to 25%:</td><td><img src="/images/scale9Grid-e.jpg" alt="display object at 25%" /></td></tr><tr><td>Stretched horizontally 150%:</td><td><img src="/images/scale9Grid-f.jpg" alt="display stretched 150%" /></td></tr></tbody></table>
<p>A common use for setting <code>scale9Grid</code> is to set up a display
object to be used as a component, in which edge regions retain the same
width when the component is scaled.</p><p class="javadoc">Throws:</p><table class="table table-bordered params"><tr class="indent"><th style="width:25%;"><code>ArgumentError</code></th><td><p>If you pass an invalid argument to the method.</p></td></tr></table></div></div><div class="field "><a name="scaleX"></a><h3 class="anchor"><code><span class="label label-meta label-meta-keep" title="Causes a field or type to be kept by DCE.">@:keep</span><a href="#scaleX"><span class="identifier">scaleX</span></a>:<a class="type" title="Float - The standard Float type, this is a double-precision IEEE 64bit float." href="../../Float.html">Float</a></code></h3><div class="doc"><p>Indicates the horizontal scale (percentage) of the object as applied from

and <code>pixelBounds</code>)  -  are described in the entry for the
Transform class.</p>
<p>Each of the transform object's properties is itself an object. This
concept is important because the only way to set new values for the matrix
or colorTransform objects is to create a new object and copy that object
into the transform.matrix or transform.colorTransform property.</p>
<p>For example, to increase the <code>tx</code> value of a display
object's matrix, you must make a copy of the entire matrix object, then
copy the new object into the matrix property of the transform object:
<code> var myMatrix:<a href="../../openfl/geom/Matrix.html#Matrix">Matrix</a> =
myDisplayObject.transform.matrix; myMatrix.tx += 10;
myDisplayObject.transform.matrix = myMatrix; </code></p>
<p>You cannot directly set the <code>tx</code> property. The following
code has no effect on <code>myDisplayObject</code>:
<code> myDisplayObject.transform.matrix.tx +=
10; </code></p>
<p>You can also copy an entire transform object and assign it to another
display object's transform property. For example, the following code
copies the entire transform object from <code>myOldDisplayObj</code> to
<code>myNewDisplayObj</code>:
<code>myNewDisplayObj.transform = myOldDisplayObj.transform;</code></p>
<p>The resulting display object, <code>myNewDisplayObj</code>, now has the

object or any of its ancestors for the specified event type. This method
returns <code><a href="../../Bool.html">true</a></code> if an event listener is triggered during any
phase of the event flow when an event of the specified type is dispatched
to this EventDispatcher object or any of its descendants.</p>
<p>The difference between the <code>hasEventListener()</code> and the
<code>willTrigger()</code> methods is that <code>hasEventListener()</code>
examines only the object to which it belongs, whereas the
<code>willTrigger()</code> method examines the entire event flow for the
event specified by the <code>type</code> parameter.</p>
<p>When <code>willTrigger()</code> is called from a LoaderInfo object,
only the listeners that the caller can access are considered.</p><p class="javadoc">Parameters:</p><table class="table table-bordered params"><tr><th style="width:25%;"><code>type</code></th><td><p>The type of event.</p></td></tr></table><p class="javadoc">Returns:</p><div class="indent inline-content"><p>A value of <code><a href="../../Bool.html">true</a></code> if a listener of the specified type
