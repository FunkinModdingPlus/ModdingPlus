a user's computer or on a server. Shared objects offer real-time data
sharing between multiple client SWF files and objects that are persistent
on the local computer or remote server. Local shared objects are similar to
browser cookies and remote shared objects are similar to real-time data
transfer devices. To use remote shared objects, you need Adobe Flash Media
Server.</p>
<p>Use shared objects to do the following:</p><ul><li><strong>Maintain local persistence</strong>. This is the simplest way to use a
shared object, and does not require Flash Media Server. For example, you
can call <code><a href="../../openfl/net/SharedObject.html#getLocal">SharedObject.getLocal</a>()</code> to create a shared object in
an application, such as a calculator with memory. When the user closes the
calculator, Flash Player saves the last value in a shared object on the
user's computer. The next time the calculator is run, it contains the
values it had previously. Alternatively, if you set the shared object's
properties to <code>null</code> before the calculator application is
closed, the next time the application runs, it opens without any values.
Another example of maintaining local persistence is tracking user
preferences or other data for a complex website, such as a record of which
articles a user read on a news site. Tracking this information allows you
to display articles that have already been read differently from new,
unread articles. Storing this information on the user's computer reduces
server load.</li><li><strong>Store and share data on Flash Media Server</strong>. A shared object
can store data on the server for other clients to retrieve. For example,
call <code><a href="../../openfl/net/SharedObject.html#getRemote">SharedObject.getRemote</a>()</code> to create a remote shared
object, such as a phone list, that is persistent on the server. Whenever a
client makes changes to the shared object, the revised data is available to
all clients currently connected to the object or who later connect to it.
If the object is also persistent locally, and a client changes data while
not connected to the server, the data is copied to the remote shared object
the next time the client connects to the object.</li><li><strong>Share data in real time</strong>. A shared object can share data among
multiple clients in real time. For example, you can open a remote shared
object that stores a list of users connected to a chat room that is visible
to all clients connected to the object. When a user enters or leaves the
chat room, the object is updated and all clients that are connected to the
object see the revised list of chat room users.</li></ul>
<p>To create a local shared object, call
<code><a href="../../openfl/net/SharedObject.html#getLocal">SharedObject.getLocal</a>()</code>. To create a remote shared object,
call <code><a href="../../openfl/net/SharedObject.html#getRemote">SharedObject.getRemote</a>()</code>.</p>
<p>When an application closes, shared objects are <em>flushed</em>, or
written to a disk. You can also call the <code>flush()</code> method to
explicitly write data to a disk.</p>
<p><strong>Local disk space considerations.</strong> Local shared objects have some
limitations that are important to consider as you design your application.
Sometimes SWF files may not be allowed to write local shared objects, and
sometimes the data stored in local shared objects can be deleted without
your knowledge. Flash Player users can manage the disk space that is
available to individual domains or to all domains. When users decrease the
amount of disk space available, some local shared objects may be deleted.
Flash Player users also have privacy controls that can prevent third-party
domains(domains other than the domain in the current browser address bar)
from reading or writing local shared objects.</p>
<p><strong>Note</strong>: SWF files that are stored and run on a local computer, not
from a remote server, can always write third-party shared objects to disk.
For more information about third-party shared objects, see the
<a href="http://www.macromedia.com/support/documentation/en/flashplayer/help/settings_manager03.html">Global Storage Settings panel</a>
in Flash Player Help.</p>
<p>It's a good idea to check for failures related to the amount of disk
space and to user privacy controls. Perform these checks when you call
<code>getLocal()</code> and <code>flush()</code>:</p><ul><li><code><a href="../../openfl/net/SharedObject.html#getLocal">SharedObject.getLocal</a>()</code>  -  Flash Player throws an
exception when a call to this method fails, such as when the user has
disabled third-party shared objects and the domain of your SWF file does
not match the domain in the browser address bar.</li><li><code><a href="../../openfl/net/SharedObject.html#flush">SharedObject.flush</a>()</code>  -  Flash Player throws an
exception when a call to this method fails. It returns
<code><a href="../../openfl/net/SharedObjectFlushStatus.html#FLUSHED">SharedObjectFlushStatus.FLUSHED</a></code> when it succeeds. It returns
<code><a href="../../openfl/net/SharedObjectFlushStatus.html#PENDING">SharedObjectFlushStatus.PENDING</a></code> when additional storage space
is needed. Flash Player prompts the user to allow an increase in storage
space for locally saved information. Thereafter, the <code>netStatus</code>
event is dispatched with an information object indicating whether the flush
failed or succeeded.</li></ul>
<p>If your SWF file attempts to create or modify local shared objects, make
sure that your SWF file is at least 215 pixels wide and at least 138 pixels
high(the minimum dimensions for displaying the dialog box that prompts
users to increase their local shared object storage limit). If your SWF
file is smaller than these dimensions and an increase in the storage limit
is required, <code><a href="../../openfl/net/SharedObject.html#flush">SharedObject.flush</a>()</code> fails, returning
<code>SharedObjectFlushedStatus.PENDING</code> and dispatching the
<code>netStatus</code> event.</p>
<p><strong>Remote shared objects.</strong> With Flash Media Server, you can create
and use remote shared objects, that are shared in real-time by all clients
connected to your application. When one client changes a property of a
remote shared object, the property is changed for all connected clients.
You can use remote shared objects to synchronize clients, for example,
users in a multi-player game.</p>
<p>Each remote shared object has a <code>data</code> property which is an
Object with properties that store data. Call <code>setProperty()</code> to
change an property of the data object. The server updates the properties,
dispatches a <code>sync</code> event, and sends the properties back to the
connected clients.</p>
<p>You can choose to make remote shared objects persistent on the client,
the server, or both. By default, Flash Player saves locally persistent
remote shared objects up to 100K in size. When you try to save a larger
object, Flash Player displays the Local Storage dialog box, which lets the
user allow or deny local storage for the shared object. Make sure your
Stage size is at least 215 by 138 pixels; this is the minimum size Flash
requires to display the dialog box.</p>
<p>If the user selects Allow, the server saves the shared object and
dispatches a <code>netStatus</code> event with a <code>code</code> property
of <code><a href="../../openfl/net/SharedObject.html#Success">SharedObject.Flush.Success</a></code>. If the user select Deny, the
server does not save the shared object and dispatches a
<code>netStatus</code> event with a <code>code</code> property of
<code><a href="../../openfl/net/SharedObject.html#Failed">SharedObject.Flush.Failed</a></code>.</p><p class="javadoc">Events:</p><table class="table table-bordered params"><tr class="indent"><th style="width:25%;"><code>asyncError</code></th><td><p>Dispatched when an exception is thrown asynchronously  -

Format version should be used: the ActionScript 3.0 format (AMF3) or the
ActionScript 1.0 or 2.0 format (AMF0).</p>
<p>For more information about object encoding, including the difference between
encoding in local and remote shared objects, see the description of the
<code>objectEncoding</code> property.</p>
<p>The default value of <code><a href="../../openfl/net/SharedObject.html#defaultObjectEncoding">SharedObject.defaultObjectEncoding</a></code> is set to use the
ActionScript 3.0 format, AMF3. If you need to write local shared objects that
ActionScript 2.0 or 1.0 SWF files can read, set
<code><a href="../../openfl/net/SharedObject.html#defaultObjectEncoding">SharedObject.defaultObjectEncoding</a></code> to use the ActionScript 1.0 or ActionScript
2.0 format, <code><a href="../../openfl/net/ObjectEncoding.html#AMF0">openfl.net.ObjectEncoding.AMF0</a></code>, at the beginning of your script,
before you create any local shared objects. All local shared objects created
thereafter will use AMF0 encoding and can interact with older content. You cannot
change the <code>objectEncoding</code> value of existing local shared objects by setting
<code><a href="../../openfl/net/SharedObject.html#defaultObjectEncoding">SharedObject.defaultObjectEncoding</a></code> after the local shared objects have been
created.</p>
<p>To set the object encoding on a per-object basis, rather than for all shared
objects created by the SWF file, set the objectEncoding property of the local
shared object instead.</p></div></div></div><h3 class="section">Static methods</h3><div class="fields"><div class="field "><a name="getLocal"></a><h3 class="anchor"><code><span class="label label-meta label-meta-value" title="Used to store default values for fields and function arguments.">@:value({ secure : false, localPath : null })</span><span class="label label-static">static</span><a href="#getLocal"><span class="identifier">getLocal</span></a>(<span style="white-space:nowrap">name:<a class="type" title="String - The basic String class." href="../../String.html">String</a>,</span> <span style="white-space:nowrap">?localPath:<a class="type" title="String - The basic String class." href="../../String.html">String</a>,</span> <span style="white-space:nowrap">secure:<a class="type" title="Bool - The standard Boolean type, which can either be true or false." href="../../Bool.html">Bool</a> = false</span>):<a class="type" title="openfl.net.SharedObject - The SharedObject class is used to read and store limited amounts of data on a user&#039;s computer or on a server." href="../../openfl/net/SharedObject.html">SharedObject</a></code></h3><div class="doc"><p>Returns a reference to a locally persistent shared object that is only
available to the current client. If the shared object does not already
exist, this method creates one. If any values passed to
<code>getLocal()</code> are invalid or if the call fails, Flash Player
throws an exception.</p>
<p>The following code shows how you assign the returned shared object
reference to a variable:</p>
<p><code>var so:<a href="../../openfl/net/SharedObject.html#SharedObject">SharedObject</a> =
<a href="../../openfl/net/SharedObject.html#getLocal">SharedObject.getLocal</a>("savedData");</code></p>
<p><strong>Note:</strong> If the user has chosen to never allow local storage for
this domain, the object is not saved locally, even if a value for
<code>localPath</code> is specified. The exception to this rule is local
content. Local content can always write shared objects from third-party
domains(domains other than the domain in the current browser address bar)
to disk, even if writing of third-party shared objects to disk is
disallowed.</p>
<p>To avoid name conflicts, Flash looks at the location of the SWF file
creating the shared object. For example, if a SWF file at
www.myCompany.com/apps/stockwatcher.swf creates a shared object named
<code>portfolio</code>, that shared object does not conflict with another
object named <code>portfolio</code> that was created by a SWF file at
www.yourCompany.com/photoshoot.swf because the SWF files originate from
different directories.</p>
<p>Although the <code>localPath</code> parameter is optional, you should
give some thought to its use, especially if other SWF files need to access
the shared object. If the data in the shared object is specific to one SWF
file that will not be moved to another location, then use of the default
value makes sense. If other SWF files need access to the shared object, or
if the SWF file that creates the shared object will later be moved, then
the value of this parameter affects how accessible the shared object will
be. For example, if you create a shared object with <code>localPath</code>
set to the default value of the full path to the SWF file, no other SWF
file can access that shared object. If you later move the original SWF
file to another location, not even that SWF file can access the data
already stored in the shared object.</p>
<p>To avoid inadvertently restricting access to a shared object, use the
<code>localpath</code> parameter. The most permissive approach is to set
<code>localPath</code> to <code>/</code>(slash), which makes the shared
object available to all SWF files in the domain, but increases the
likelihood of name conflicts with other shared objects in the domain. A
more restrictive approach is to append <code>localPath</code> with folder
names that are in the full path to the SWF file. For example, for a
<code>portfolio</code> shared object created by the SWF file at
www.myCompany.com/apps/stockwatcher.swf, you could set the
<code>localPath</code> parameter to <code>/</code>, <code>/apps</code>, or
<code>/apps/stockwatcher.swf</code>. You must determine which approach
provides optimal flexibility for your application.</p>
<p>When using this method, consider the following security model:</p><ul><li>You cannot access shared objects across sandbox boundaries.</li><li>Users can restrict shared object access by using the Flash Player
Settings dialog box or the Settings Manager. By default, an application
can create shared objects of up 100 KB of data per domain. Administrators
and users can also place restrictions on the ability to write to the file
system.</li></ul>
<p>Suppose you publish SWF file content to be played back as local files
(either locally installed SWF files or EXE files), and you need to access
a specific shared object from more than one local SWF file. In this
situation, be aware that for local files, two different locations might be
used to store shared objects. The domain that is used depends on the
security permissions granted to the local file that created the shared
object. Local files can have three different levels of permissions:</p><ol><li>Access to the local filesystem only.</li><li>Access to the network only.</li><li>Access to both the network and the local filesystem.</li></ol>
<p>Local files with access to the local filesystem(level 1 or 3) store
their shared objects in one location. Local files without access to the
local filesystem(level 2) store their shared objects in another
location.</p>
<p>You can prevent a SWF file from using this method by setting the
<code>allowNetworking</code> parameter of the the <code>object</code> and
<code>embed</code> tags in the HTML page that contains the SWF
content.</p>
